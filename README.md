## Problem Domain 

Due to the Covid-19 many of youth get out of thier Education industry so,
we decided to build an education website for people who are interested in self-learning and update their skills continuously.  
Once you open the website you will find all the categories, each one containing a set of courses displayed depending on its level. 
Also, we like to offer  an internship training for users after they have finished the courses to get into parctical experince . In addition to the existence of our speakers and the ability to users to exchange their skills between themselves.
